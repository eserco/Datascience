89.5/100

Feedback:

1.1 good [5/5]
1.2 plot should have contained the word frequencies vs the rank of the words on a log-log scale [-2]
1.3 [10/10]
1.4 a) Provided 10 most frequent collocations each with at most 1 proper name (5/5)
    b. Performed this for multiple window sizes (5/5). 
    c. Provided discussion of effect of changing the window size. (5/5).
1.5 Performed sensible dimensionality reduction technique on the data. (5/5)
    Visualization is not helpful due to lack of labels (1.5/5) - which document does which of the dots represent?
    Lack of interpretability of the scatterplots could be reason for lack of a sound discussion of the results. For example, whether genre based clusters are formed or whether works of some authors form clusters, or works from a certain era form clusters, etc.(0/5)

2.1: Good
