Feedback:

1.1 Correct calculations, but the dendrogram distance axis doesnâ€™t match it
1.2 Correct

2.1.  Which difficulties do you encounter?
It would be nice if you ensured that the sample is representative by looking at their means/variance w.r.t. Census. It is appreciated that you show a PCA plot with 2 components. Although you bootstrap the data, you still need to be sure that each sample is representative. 4/5

2.2.  What differences are there between the 3d and 6d representation of the data? 5/5

2.3.  Plot the dendrograms. Work on the visualization, especially the labels do not contribute any information..You need more datapoints in the dendrogram to give an accurate description of the proposed clusterings. How did you obtain these samples? Are they really representative compared to the census? 2/5

2.4.  How do the clusterings change when different linkages are considered? Why are the linkages you suggest are better? 5/5


3.1: beside the time complexity, it would better if you talked about the distribution of values in these two datasets and how the results of clustering might change by using these two. 

3.2: Why did you choose to stop clustering values at 40 ? why did not consider larger values?
What about using normalization techniques on your dataset? Or What is your sampling technique?

3.3: Good job

4.1 pseudo code and its explanation: 10/10
4.2 - explained the sampling technique and methodology well 5/5
Compared the outcome of two types of initializations. However a more complete picture would have been provided by boxplots showing the mean and variance at each k over n-folds of CV: (3+5)/10
