The team was able to defend their presentation  answer questions asked by the audience if it was within the scope of topic :
-> 12.467 out of 16.667 points

* Comments  motivation for the above:

The content was really clear and also very understandable for the topic.
 
 The content was explained clearly and logically.
 It was a difficult topic, I think you explained it well
 I think the examples from the notebook supported the slides well. Content appears in line with what was asked. Slides looked good, content was readable despite the laptop screen.
  
* What did you like about the presentation :
Very nice figures and examples, 
clear explanation of problem and motivation,
knowledgeable confident presenters,
questions mostly well answered,
very nice survival titanic example!
good to relate this to prior lectures and topics known
This team had a quite nice demo to show how the theory/method works. Also, they delivered the contents in the influent way.  
 The slides and figures were nice. Most concepts were explained well.
 The thread in this presentation was good. I also learned a lot listening to this presentation.
 The speakers spoke with convidence and knew their topics.
 The speakers were easy to understand and explained their parts of the presentation well. Clever use of two laptops instead of one to have presentation and notebook open at the same time.
  
* What are your suggestions for improvement :
the embedded methods were the weak point (you had a nice example the Decision tree, but did not fully utilize it), 
some confusion with the difference of wrapper and embedded (special purpose algos, advice to read more closely),
mention important keywords, such as forward selection and backward elimination,
list (dis)advantages for each method (as you did for embedded) and relate methods to each other to help people decide which one suits their situation, 
Conclusion (take home message) is missing

 
 Maybe some more demonstrations?
 The slides had too many words. In the question answering, you tried scrolling to the slide that was on the topic of the question, but the scrolling lasted for the entire duration of the question and I found that a bit distracting
 Perhaps at some point the bridging between the sub parts of the topic could  be better? (might be slightly nitpicky)
