You should implement kNN using N-fold CV . Your tables and captions in KNN is vague as it does not contain any information on number on neighbors. Also you were supposed to test DT for two different splitting criteria. You also were supposed to apply cross validation on both DT and KNN and compare the results.  (13/25)
k=1,2 are not proper selection for KNN. K = 2 is a dangerous value to use. What if it is equally split? How does the algorithm decide which class to assign? And do you want a coin flip to decide health/sick? (20/25)
There are more rooms for discussion. You Need to show of results of best 5 performing classifiers, Explain summary of the various experiments and Conclude the process. (10/25)
